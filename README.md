### Technologies

It was built using the following technologies

-   Laravel Framework
-   [Canvas](http://cnvs.io) Publishing Package (Which borrows heavily on [Wink](https://wink.themsaid.com/))

### Guide on how to get yours up and running
See the commits for the step by step commits

### My Random Thoughts
_Also I attempted using Wink without Canvas, It required lots of setting up to get it up and running. Canvas made the whole process easier to get up and running_
